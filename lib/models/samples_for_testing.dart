  Story 1 - Two girls come into my place Girl A has a problem, 
  Girl B is here to help. Firstly I boil water, while waiting 
  for it to boil Girl A is busy playing around with it(e.g. 
  putting water in and out of the bucket using a jar). Meanwhile 
  Girl B is going through the climax process(foot spanking, ass 
  spanking, body massage, dominance, etc). When the water is boiling 
  Girl B gives Girl A  hanging pex, thereafter Girl A will steam with 
  these hanging pex on her niples, that is when I will start 
  fingering Girl B. When Girl A is done steaming, she will go through 
  the process Girl B went through, however Girl B will be helping out 
  by playing with Girl A's clit until she comes at which point I will 
  start penetrating Girl A . That is pretty much it.

* Fight for what you want now, or fight for what you don't want later, you choose. {}
* Greatness is a craft, greatness is a process, greatness is a habit, greatness is a little things that you do every day over time. 
Going out everyday unaffraid of whether or not this is one of the ten thousand tarrible things that you gonna do, 
it's bieng unaffraid to make those mistakes, it's bieng unaffraid that you not yet great.

* The level of  battle you face is an indication of the level of blessings that you stand to recieve.

* No one attempts the impossible without belief in something greater than themselves.
* It doesn't matter how slow you go, as long as you do not stop.{}
* We are the product of our mistakes.


* Remember this, only as high as you rich can you grow, only as far as you seek 
can you go, only as deep as you can look can you see,and only as much as you 
can dream can you be.

* To go against the dominant thinking of your family, friends, and those 
people you associate with everyday, is perhaps the most difficult active 
carrage you will ever perform.

* When writting a story of your life, don't let anyone hold the pen. Once you do, 
that's when you die before you ever had a chance to live.

* You want the secret? It's called work, do not get confused here. You have to 
work to match the ambition coming out of your mouth.

*Figure out who you are, don't apologize for who you are, and then become 
even greater than you naturally are, at what you are.

* It easy to move quikly when you don't care about the quality control. {}
* Follow you heart your body will catch up.
* If i have learnt anything in life, it that anything is possible.

* The whole game is broken, because everybody is too tied up into other people's 
opinions. I only care about my opinion of myself,and i care about what my family, 
friends, partner and the world think. Just not as much as i care about the way i think 
about myself.

* First step before you engage yourself on things that your heart love the most,
you gotta identify your gift. Because your gift will find a room for you.

* Defining ourself by what we are not, is the first step that leed us to knowing who we really are.

* You wanna have joy in your life? Good, now you got to start eliminating the who's, the where's, 
the when's, the what's and how's that will keep you from your identity.

* Nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit, it about how hard you
can get hit and keep moving forward, how much you can take and keep moving forward. 
Now if you know what you worth, now go out and get what you are worth, but you gotta be 
willing to take the hits.

* If you don't disciple your emotions they will use you.
* There is no price too great for me, there is no amount that i am not willing to go,
 i would die for my dreams.
* Small and steady wins the race.
* Small daily improvements over time will lead you to stunning result.
* .Working hard is the cost of entry to anything.
* See it, believe it, and then do it.
* Fear is a lair its activate the enemy.
* With little desciple you do little things, with alot of desciple you do alot of things.
* Life is a journey of discovering who i am and i know that greed, 
emotion, and fatige will demage my judgement in that journey, and what will enhence it
is keeping an open mind and seeking the councel of others.

* Pain of discipline or pain of regret, which one you choose?
* Make sure you have the best defence against the future.
* In competition, individual ambition serves the common goal.
* My first grade teacher said i was born with two helpings of brain but only half a helping of heart.
* By the age of 35, i want to look back and say i did well, before i retire.

* Take ownership, take extreme ownership. Don't make excuses, don't blame any other person or any other thing. 
Get control of your ego. Take ownership of everything in your world, the good and the bad. Take ownership of 
your mistakes, take ownership of your short falls, take ownership of your problems and then take ownership of the 
solutions that will get those problem solved. Take ownership of your job, team,mission, future...And lead to victory.

*. There are many ways to get the things that we want for our selves in our lifes, 
but basically it all begins with how we choose to think.
* Being a good listener and being able to connect with people are the keys to leadership.
* I know it sound selfish if you say it hashly, it's not my mother's life, it's not my father's life, 
 nor is it my partner's life, it's my life, so i'l follow my inner voice, not their opinion regarding 
my future.

* I found my fighting style, tai chi.
 * Success comes when there is no longer an option, no longer a choince. When it's do or die.

* Music gives me power and that makes me unstoppable.
* Darkness makes the legends that you see in the light.

* The first step that leads to our identity in life is usually not knowing who you are, 
it's actually knowing who you are not it called the process of elimination.
* Wise thinking leads to right living, stupid thinking leads to wrong living.

* Some guy was asked in a gym, how many sit ups you do? He said i don't start counting until it hurts.
That is working hard.

* You must be imaginitive, strong hearted, you must try things, they may not work. But you must not let anyone 
define your limits because of where you come from, your only limit is your soul.

* At the end of your feelings there is nothing, but at the end of every principle there is a promise.
*Don't ever give up, faith is a substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. It's real hard hoping.

* Disappoinment can be turn into drive or disappointment can distroy you.

* Funa into ethandwa yihliziyo yakho ezokwenzela imali kusenesikhathi. Mawuhlulekile, 
uzosebenza umsebenzi ongawuthandi, usebenzela abantu abayifuna bayithola kusenesikhathi.
abantu abayifuna bayithola.

* Learn how to love to lose.
* I'm invinsible
* I wanna build the biggest building in town, ever, by just building the biggest building in town, 
while I think most people try to tie down everybody else's building .

* Only a man who knows what it's like to be defeated, 
can reach down to the bottom of his soul and come up 
with the extra ounce of power it takes to win. When the match even.
* A winner is a looser who tried one more time.

* If you not willing to risk you cannot grow, and if you cannot grow you 
cannot become your best, and if you cannot become your best you cannot 
be happy, and if you cannot be happy what else is there?

* It's better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have one, then to have an opportunity and not be prepared.
* By not pursuing your goal, deciding to go to a job that you don't like, you are literally commiting spiritual suicide.

* Creativity, Decisivness, Passion, Honesty, Love, Sincerity, these are the ultamate human resources. 
When you engage these resources, you can get any other resource on earth.

* Look at a man the way that he is he only becomes worse, 
but look at him as if he were what he could be than he becomes what he should be.

*You are more than your RESULTS to this point in your life.
* Don't complain or explain
* Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.

* Ukuthi ngangifuna ukuzazi kuqala ukuthi empilweni ngingubani, ngibhekephi, ngayiphi inhloso,
kuyima ngibaqambela amanga ngokuzethemba ngoba bayawathanda. Ngangeke ngizenze isilima 
ngibaqambele amanga athandekayo ngazi kahle ukuthi angizithandi ngenxa yokuthi angazi ukuthi
empilweni ngingubani, ngibhekephi, ngayiphi inhloso.

* I am more than this, I haven't got more because i wasn't hungry enough. Now i am hungry enough, I am more than 
hungry, I'm starving. Now...I must, Now...I will. Nothing will stop me, Because i will no longer stop myself. I am more 
than this...

* Keep away from those who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great ones,
they make you believe that you too can become great. That's the king of people you wanna surround yourself with.

* With every great thing in life there is gonna be sacrifice, with every great thing in life there is gonna be work, and with 
every great thing in life there is gonna be time. You're gonna have to make difficult decisions, you're gonna have to put in 
the work, and you're gonna have to be patient. But if you can combine those three things, that what makes great things 
happen, that what builds epic lives and builds ultimate realizations of potential.

*.The people that you see that win at a highest level they are the ones that didn't give up, they are survivors. And you gotta ask your self. 
I am a survivor type? Am I a type of person that continues to push throught when it gets hard, when its get boring,when i feel loss, when i 
don't know what i am doing, when i have no faith in myself? Even in that darkest hour, can i push forward? Can i accept that the human 
body will respond to that stress?

* The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows, it's a very mean and nasty place, and i don't care
how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it.

*You shouldn't need a calender to switch to another number for you to get motivated. If you are waiting for that to better yourself,
